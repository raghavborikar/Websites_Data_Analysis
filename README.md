This project focuses on cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing a dataset that provides insights 
into the top 50 websites across 191 countries. The dataset includes a mix of categorical and 
continuous variables, capturing various aspects of website performance, such as global and 
country-specific rankings, user engagement metrics, social media influence, 
trustworthiness, and hosting details. 
The primary goal of this project is to uncover meaningful patterns and trends in website 
performance at a global and regional level. The analysis involves handling missing values, 
correcting data inconsistencies, and transforming the data into a usable format. Exploratory 
Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to identify correlations, trends, and anomalies, followed by 
creating dashboards that present key insights in an interactive and visually engaging format. 
By leveraging tools such as Python, SQL, and dashboarding platforms (Power BI), this project 
aims to analyse various websites on their regional & global parameters as well as based on 
their global functioning & identity. 
The final deliverables include clean and well-structured data, comprehensive insights from 
analysis, and intuitive dashboards, making this project a valuable resource for understanding 
the global and regional dynamics of website performance.
